# CreditApprovalClassifier
CreditApprovalClassifier: Utilizing KSV and KNN algorithms for credit approval classification

Description
The aim of this project was to build a method/alogrithm to classify credit card applications based on given variables as provided in the dataset. The ML alogrithm applied in this project provided a classification threshold for each variable. This project goes from exploratory data analysis to the final predictive outcome. 

Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval
The dataset used to build this alogrithm is similar to the dataset available on the UCI website albeit some changes made for easy manipulation and data transformation.

This project was done on Rstudio (R programming language). All libraries needed are available in the source code file.
