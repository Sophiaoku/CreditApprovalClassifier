# CreditApprovalClassifier
CreditApprovalClassifier: Utilizing KSV and KNN algorithms for credit approval classification

Description

The aim of this project was to build a method/algorithm to classify credit card applications based on given variables provided in the dataset. The machine learning algorithm applied in this project offers a classification threshold for each variable, allowing for accurate prediction. The project encompasses the entire process, from exploratory data analysis to the final predictive outcome.

Dataset

The dataset used to develop this algorithm is sourced from the UCI website, with slight modifications made for improved data manipulation and transformation. You can access the dataset through the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval

Environmental and Dependencies 

This project was implemented using RStudio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language. The necessary libraries required for running the source code file are included and documented within the project.
